Codes and data sets for my machine learning journey

Started with a few online courses to learn Data Analysis, Machine Learning and Deep Learning since April 2020 (lockdown due to the pandemic). This repository is a way to store all my code and use it as my ML/DL project portfolio.

The files have been named as follows:
###"AlgorithmName_Dataset.ipynb"
The code is in .ipynb format and should be preferably run in either Jupyter Notebooks or Google Collab. The datasets are provided in a folder called "Datasets" so that relevant datasets can be downloaded and used.
